			   		<h2> Beginning</h2>
			   		<p>My story began when I was 6 years old. My parents originally signed me up for the local hockey team but then figured it was too dangerous to play. They then decided to sign me up for table tennis classes because it was one of the safest sports. At first I really disliked table tennis but as I grew older I began to develop interest and love for the sport. Today I am nineteen years old and I am glad to say that my commitment to the sport and my heart to never quit has truly paid off.  </p>

			   		<h2> Local</h2>
			   		<p>Throughout the years, I participated in many local tournaments. These tournaments ranged from community, city and provincial level tournaments. Through participating in local events I was able to train and develop my skills before entering into national and international tournaments. I consistently ranked first in my age group throughout British Columbia. Notable results include, 2x Highschool Provincial Champion and 6x Team BC tryout winner.</p>

			   		<h2> Nationals</h2>
			   		<p>Every year I participated in the Canadian Table Tennis National Championships. This was the main event for our provincial team every year as we trained 4 hours a day during the summer leading up to the tournament. Long hours of preparation with teammates, coaches and parents went into this annual event. Notable results include: U15 Boys Teams-Gold Medalist, U18 Boys Teams-Bronze Medalist, Men's Teams-Bronze Medalist.</p>

			   		<h2>Continental</h2>
			   		<p>In 2016 I was given the opportunity to represent Canada in the Pan American Junior Championships. 10 males and 10 females under the age of 18 were selected according to national ranking to represent Canada in this tournament. Countries from across North and South America participated in the major continental event. I had the great privilege of practicing and competing with many different players from all different countries. The most notable memory from this event was defeating the third seeded Brazilian team during the round robin stage of the teams event.</p>

			   		<h2>Canada Winter Games</h2>
			   		<p>The Canada Winter Games is a national multi-sport event that is hosted every four years. Participating in this event was one of my major goals throughout my career. With tough competition, only 3 men and 3 women would be selected to represent the provincial team in the event. In 2018 I was able to fight my way through by winning 2 consecutive tryouts to retain a spot on the team roster. With my teammates, we together spent half a year preparing for this tournament, and in the end our hard work truly paid off. Together we won the bronze medal for the Menâ€™s Teams event, and I myself, achieved the bronze medal for the Men's Singles Event.</p>

			   		<h2>Summer Universiade</h2>
			   		<p>The Summer Universiade is the largest multi-sport event in the world apart from the Olympic Games. I was very honored to be given the opportunity to represent Canada on such a big stage. This experience truly allowed me to gain new insights and ideas on the world. I met people of different ethnicities from all different countries and learned. Through the Summer Universiade Games, I was able to make many new friendships and develop very meaningful connections with people across the world that I will never forget.</p>

			   		<h2>Community</h2>
			   		<p>Though I enjoyed playing and competing professionally, what I enjoy more is giving back to the community. I volunteered as the table tennis head coach for my local community center. Through this experience I was able to contribute to the growth and development of many younger players. As the head coach, my main goal was to spark passion within my students for sports through having fun with table tennis. Coaching the younger generation has been one of the greatest privileges of my life. Not only was I able to foster meaningful connections with my students, but I was also able to discover the great joy in guiding and helping others.</p>

			   		<h2>Support</h2>
			   		<p>I have so many people I want to thank for shaping me into the person I am today. First off is my parents, they have been the ones by my side since day one. They have always inspired, encouraged and supported me throughout the whole journey. Without their love and care for me, I would never have gotten to where I am today. Secondly I want to thank my mentor and coaches. Their great advice and guidance for me has always pointed me in the right direction. With their help, I am now stronger mentally to take on bigger tasks in life. Finally, I want to thank all my teammates. They were always there to support me on and off the court. The experiences of losing, fighting, training, and winning together will never be forgotten.</p>

			   		<h2> Conclusion</h2>
			   		<p></p>
			   		<p>This journey of table tennis has been the greatest experience in my life so far. I have learned to be more resilient, determined, focused and grateful in life. I am now better at taking losses, failures and learning from my mistakes. I have also gained many new ideas, experiences and insights in my life from travelling and meeting people from across the world. In this new stage of my life, I plan to take with me all the lessons I have learned into the working industry. I will continue to set goals for myself while working the hardest I can to achieve them. I am only in the beginning stages of my life and I recognize there are still so many harder obstacles ahead of me to overcome; however, thanks to table tennis, I am now able to open my arms wide and accept these challenges to learn and grow and hopefully create change in this world one day.</p>
